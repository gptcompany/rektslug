# Provider API Comparison Workflow

## Scope

This runbook documents the current workflow for capturing and comparing raw
liquidation data across external providers:

- CoinAnk
- Coinglass
- Bitcoin CounterFlow

The goal is to compare raw API payloads before making assumptions about how any
provider computes or visualizes liquidation maps.

## Current State

Two scripts now cover the workflow:

- `scripts/capture_provider_api.py`
- `scripts/compare_provider_liquidations.py`

The first script captures raw JSON responses during page load with Playwright.
The second script reads one or more capture manifests, normalizes the most
relevant liquidation dataset per provider, and emits a comparison report.

A third script now orchestrates the full workflow:

- `scripts/run_provider_api_comparison.py`

This wrapper performs capture, normalization, comparison, report writing, and
optional DuckDB persistence in one command.

## Naming Convention

The repository uses `snake_case` for Python scripts under `scripts/`. The new
files follow that convention intentionally:

- `capture_provider_api.py`
- `compare_provider_liquidations.py`

Do not rename these to kebab-case unless the whole script naming convention in
the repo changes. Kebab-case is acceptable for Markdown docs, so this file uses
`provider-api-comparison.md`.

## Capture Workflow

### 1. Capture provider traffic

Examples:

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_provider_api.py \
  --provider bitcoincounterflow
```

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_provider_api.py \
  --provider both \
  --coin BTC \
  --timeframe 1w \
  --coinglass-url "https://www.coinglass.com/..."
```

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_provider_api.py \
  --provider all \
  --coin BTC \
  --timeframe 1w \
  --coinglass-url "https://www.coinglass.com/..."
```

Captures are written under:

`data/validation/raw_provider_api/<timestamp>/`

Each run contains:

- one subdirectory per provider
- `summary.json` per provider
- `manifest.json` for the whole run

### 2. Compare captured payloads

```bash
python3 scripts/compare_provider_liquidations.py \
  --manifest data/validation/raw_provider_api/<timestamp>/manifest.json
```

If no manifest is provided, the script uses the latest capture run.

Reports are written under:

`data/validation/provider_comparisons/`

### 3. Run the full workflow in one command

```bash
python3 scripts/run_provider_api_comparison.py \
  --provider all \
  --coin BTC \
  --timeframe 1w
```

By default, this command also persists normalized comparison rows into the
validation DuckDB (`data/validation/validation_results.duckdb`). Use
`--no-persist-db` if you want a file-only run.

## Provider-Specific Notes

### CoinAnk

- Capture is page-driven and reuses the existing CoinAnk login flow.
- Raw payload parsing is currently heuristic.
- Once a stable CoinAnk liquidation endpoint is captured, add a dedicated
  parser instead of relying on generic field matching.

### Coinglass

- Capture requires an explicit `--coinglass-url`.
- Login support is best-effort.
- Raw payload parsing is currently heuristic.
- As with CoinAnk, the next step is a dedicated parser once the endpoint shape
  is known.

### Bitcoin CounterFlow

- `scripts/capture_provider_api.py` explicitly triggers a fetch for
  `/api/liquidations`.
- The endpoint is not fully public. It returns `403` without an allowed
  `Origin`.
- It returns `200` when called from:
  - `https://bitcoincounterflow.com`
  - the extension origin
- The comparison script parses this payload explicitly as a USD-notional
  liquidation time-series.

Important distinction:

- `api/liquidations` is a raw time-series feed
- the website/extension `Liquidation Heatmap` view also has a client-side
  synthetic heatmap path built from proxied Binance klines

Do not assume these two views are the same dataset.

## What Is Still Missing

The workflow is usable, but it is not complete yet.

The main missing pieces are:

1. Dedicated parsers for CoinAnk raw payloads
2. Dedicated parsers for Coinglass raw payloads
3. Schema-level comparison once at least two providers have stable captured
   liquidation endpoints
4. Optional historical aggregation across many capture runs

Today, Bitcoin CounterFlow and CoinAnk have provider-specific parsers.

CoinAnk now also has a provider-specific parser for `getAggLiqMap`, but its
long/short split is still inferred by dividing bins around `lastPrice` because
the endpoint exposes one magnitude array per exchange rather than separate long
and short arrays.

Coinglass now has a provider-specific parser for the current encoded response
envelope, but numeric decoding of its encrypted payload is still missing.

## DuckDB: Needed or Not?

DuckDB is already part of this repository and already stores the core project
data.

The real question here is narrower:

- should the provider-comparison workflow stay file-based for now
- or should it also persist normalized comparison data into the existing DuckDB

At the current stage, a **new DuckDB-backed comparison layer is not required
yet**.

JSON files plus a normalized comparison report are enough while:

- the provider payload shapes are still being discovered
- the number of runs is low
- the main task is reverse engineering endpoints and units

The existing validation DuckDB becomes a good next step when you start doing
repeated, cross-run analysis such as:

- comparing many days of captures
- joining provider snapshots by rounded timestamp
- tracking drift in totals, peaks, and bucket counts over time
- building aggregate statistics across dozens or hundreds of runs

Recommended rule:

- Use JSON first for discovery and parser development
- Reuse the existing validation DuckDB after provider schemas are stable enough
  to justify a tabular model

When that threshold is reached, prefer adding comparison tables to the current
validation DuckDB instead of introducing a separate storage system.

## DuckDB Tables

When DuckDB persistence is enabled, the comparison workflow creates and updates
these tables in the validation DuckDB:

- `provider_comparison_runs`
- `provider_comparison_datasets`
- `provider_comparison_pairs`

These tables are intended for normalized provider-comparison metadata only.
They do not replace the raw JSON capture artifacts stored on disk.

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Capture one real CoinAnk run and one real Coinglass run for the same symbol
   and timeframe.
2. Inspect the saved payloads and add provider-specific parsers to
   `scripts/compare_provider_liquidations.py`.
3. Only after those parsers are stable, consider a DuckDB-backed historical
   comparison layer.
